# In Class Labs for EDS223-Made by Maeve
This Repo covers all the 223 labs that I (Maeve) make in class, I use this to practice spatial imaging and R coding. Each week will have its own little folder with code and data. 
If a bug is spotted-shoot me an email (maeveli@ucsb.edu) and we can figure out together what's going on. Include the code ran, the error message recieved, and a screenshot of what you're working with. 
I'd appreciate it if you didn't contribute to this! Its my work for a class and a record of my process for research.
